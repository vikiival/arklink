## MILESTONE 2 PLAN: Ark Link

**Team:** Ark Link Core  
**Track:** [x] SHIP-A-TON [ ] IDEA-TON  
**Date:** Feb 14, 2025

## 📍 WHERE WE ARE NOW

**What we built/validated this weekend:**
- Delivered a decentralized Linktree UI that hydrates profile hero + social tabs from Arkiv-stored payloads resolved via `/?u=<handle>`.
- Encrypted every payload with AES-256-GCM and linked the symmetric keys to NFC conference badges for physical custody.
- Built the Mint Meet Memo POAP claim experience plus the Web3 tab actions (Nova Wallet tip + memo mint).

**What's working:**
- Dynamic read path from `/api/u/:handle` that renders Social + Web3 tabs responsively.
- Encrypted storage on Arkiv with NFC-bound keys, ensuring only badge holders can own/update their profile.

**What still needs work:**
- No creator-friendly way to publish a new profile (missing create form + encryption UX).
- Editing/updating existing payloads is manual; requires an inline edit form that re-encrypts and pushes to Arkiv.
- Personal memos are static; need a tuned generative model to craft unique per-attendee drops.

**Blockers or hurdles we hit:**
- Coordinating NFC key distribution + ensuring the create/edit flows can derive the correct AES key client-side.
- Need GPU/hosting resources to fine-tune and serve the personal memo generation model.

## 🚀 WHAT WE'LL SHIP IN 30 DAYS

**Our MVP will do this:**
Give every badge holder a self-serve dashboard to create or edit their decentralized Linktree profile, encrypt it with their NFC key, and publish to Arkiv in minutes. Each user also gets a personalized “Meet Memo” generated by an on-brand model to capture their presence at events.

### Features We'll Build (3-5 max)

**Week 1-2:**
- Feature: Creator onboarding + create form (inputs for avatar, bio, socials) with client-side AES encryption + Arkiv write.
- Why it matters: Unlocks new profiles without core-team assistance and enforces NFC-gated publishing.
- Who builds it: Viki 

**Week 2-3:**
- Feature: Edit form + versioning (fetch existing payload, decrypt via NFC key, allow updates, push diff).
- Why it matters: Ensures profiles stay fresh while keeping encrypted custody under badge holders.
- Who builds it: Viki

**Week 3-4:**
- Feature: Generative personal memo model tuning + integration into dotmemo claim page.
- Why it matters: Makes every memo unique and meaningful, increasing engagement + shareability.
- Who builds it: Viki

*(Add more if needed, max 5 total)*

### Team Breakdown (if applicable)

**Viki Val - Founder** | 16 hrs/week  
- Owns: Creator UI (create/edit forms), profile hero/link tree polish


### Mentoring & Expertise We Need

**Areas where we need support:**
- Best practices for storing/retrieving AES keys via NFC chips while maintaining UX.
- Guidance on Arkiv performance tuning + query cost optimization.

**Specific expertise we're looking for:**
- Cryptography reviewer who has shipped secure client-side AES workflows.
- Generative AI expert to accelerate lightweight fine-tuning + on-device inference strategies.

## 🎯 WHAT HAPPENS AFTER

**When M2 is done, we plan to...** 
- Run a pilot with badge holders at the next Polkadot conference and capture feedback on the self-serve dashboard.
- Open up profile creation to partners (artists, founders) via referral codes so the ecosystem grows organically.

**And 6 months out we see our project achieve:**
- Thousands of encrypted Linktrees hosted on Arkiv, all self-managed via NFC badges.
- Personal memos evolving into dynamic collectibles that bridge IRL events with onchain identity.
